            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Aniket Soni, a fervent Full Stack Software Engineer and Data Analyst with a profound fascination for all things tech. My expedition into the realm of technology commenced with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Gujarat Technological University in India. I subsequently pursued a Master's in Computer Science from Southern Arkansas University in the United States, where my passion for software development and data analysis deepened.

                Currently, I thrive as a Software Engineer/Data Analyst at Cognizant Technology Solutions, deeply immersed in constructing intricate ETL pipelines, crafting Python and PySpark programs for automated data quality checks, and ingeniously integrating APIs. My primary goal here is to ensure data quality and privacy are upheld to the highest standards while maintaining impeccable automation and efficiency.

                In a part-time capacity, I serve as a volunteer Research Software Engineer at Climate Change Xplorers, harnessing machine learning and data science to engage in geospatial data analysis with IoT data. Beyond my professional commitments, I find joy in mentoring young talents in the tech realm, contributing to organizations like FEA India and ENGin.
